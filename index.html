        <h1> Welcome to Recruiter </h1>

        <h2> A platform that increases recruiting efficiency </h2>

        <p> 
            Our goal is to create a system of checks and balances that helps coaches gain access to accurate and validated information
            so that they can more efficiently and effectively recruit young prospective athletes
        </p>

        <h3> How does out platform help coaches? </h3>

        <P> Our platform assists coaches by consolidating information about recruits that are highly valuable to college coaches, 
            but hard for college coaches to determine without gathering this information themselves. Additionally, this platform promotes
            the spread of accurate information through the use of checks and balances. The inclusion of training facilities to gather measurements
            on recruits provides a third party that benefits from reporting accurate data about it's recruits. Coaches also have the ability to search
            for and keep in touch with recruits on our application. 
        </P>
